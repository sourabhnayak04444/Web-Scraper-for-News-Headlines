# Web-Scraper-for-News-Headlines
This project is a simple Python web scraper that collects top news headlines from the Times of India website. 
It uses the Requests library to fetch the webpageâ€™s HTML content and BeautifulSoup to parse and extract the headline text. 
The scraped headlines are then saved into a text file named "headlines.txt". 
The main goal of this project is to automate the collection of news headlines from a public website using basic web scraping techniques.
